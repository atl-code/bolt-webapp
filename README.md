# BoltWebApp
 
This is a sample web app in PHP using MySQL as back-end.
Create DB named bolt
run bolt.sql
Update DB connection in config.php

You can also point to this from an AWS CloudFormation template to automatically deploy a HA architecture and deploy this app on Apache web servers.
One example of that is this:
